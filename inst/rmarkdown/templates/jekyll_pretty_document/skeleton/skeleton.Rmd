## A New Output Format

`html_pretty` in the [**prettydoc**](http://github.com/yixuan/prettydoc/)
package is a new output format for creating HTML document from R Markdown files.
`html_pretty` is more lightweight compared to `html_document`, and is more
stylish than `html_vignette` when creating package vignettes.
